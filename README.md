A general recommendation is to only use the leveling filter for races, start of a challenge league or when you level a new character. When you play with a fully geared character the Endgame filter will be much better. If you have a reasonable amount of magic find you can use the MF filter.

- **Leveling filter** is good for the start of the league or first leveling in a new league. It includes the racing filter and all the way to level 100. Shows most items.
- **Leveling filter - FOR CASTERS** is good for the start of the league or first leveling in a new league. Includes the racing filter and all the way to level 100. Shows most items. Same as the regular one except that normal and magic leveling weapons are hidden.
- **Endgame filter** is good for general use and racing (till a1m). It filters mediocre items. Use this when you try to power level or if you don't care so much about items anymore (use when you are resist. cap and have your basic flasks set up for maps).
- **Magic Find (MF) filter** hides even more stuff. Use this if you really don't want to id more rares than you „have to“. It will hide all non top base rares, RGB items, all non unique flasks, hammers for chisel recipe, Scraps, Whetstones, Baubles, Wisdom and Portal Scrolls.
This version is active when both the "Leveling" and "Endgame" blocks are disabled.
